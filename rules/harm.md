# Harm

Harm refers to a character's physical injuries, including wounds, scratches, concussions, internal bleeding, and poisoning.

Harm is categorized into three levels:

- Level 1 Harm indicates mild concussions, scratches, or dizziness
- Level 2 Harm indicates more severe cuts, bruises, and trauma
- Level 3 Harm indicates open wounds, organ stabs, missing limbs, and similar injuries

A character can have a maximum of two Level 1 Harm, two Level 2 Harm, and one Level 3 Harm by default.

If a character receives a Level 1 Harm while already having all Level 1 Harm Slots filled, it is upgraded to a Level 2 Harm. The same rule applies to all other Levels of Harm. If a character receives Level 4 Harm, they will die.

While a character has Harm, they roll fewer dice, equal to the highest Level of Harm they have. A character's Harm can be reduced by [Healing](healing.md).

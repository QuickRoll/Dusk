# Stress

Stress refers to a character's mental strain, and it can be harnessed as a resource to improve their chances of success in various tasks, avoid harm, use special abilities, or push themselves towards achieving their objectives.

By default, each character is allotted 8 Stress Slots, and if their Stress Slots are fully consumed, they will fall unconscious for 4â€“8 hours, or until their Stress levels are reduced.

There are two main ways to reduce Stress: sleeping and engaging in stress-relieving activities. If a character has had their basic needs, such as food and water, met for the day, sleeping for at least 4 hours can reduce their Stress by 1 point. Additionally, a character can engage in activities that provide relief or pleasure, such as praying at a church, excessive drinking, or gambling, to reduce their Stress levels if approved by the Game Master.

To reduce Stress through activities, each player rolls a number of dice equal to their lowest Attribute Rating. The character's Stress level is then reduced by the highest value rolled. If a character has an Attribute Rating of 0, they instead roll two dice and use the lower value. However, if the value of the dice roll exceeds the character's Stress level, they will overindulge.

The Game Master will decide on the potential negative consequences of overindulging, which may include actions such as oversharing, revealing secrets, or starting a brawl.

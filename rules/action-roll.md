# Action Roll

An Action Roll is made when a Character is attempting something that:

1. has a chance to fail
2. has consequences when failed

As part of the [Conversation](conversation.md) the Player declares what Action they will be taking. A [Roll](dice-pool.md) is made based in the Rating of the Action, the result of which determines how successful the Character is.

| Result  | Outcome |
| -------------: | :------------- |
| 6,6  | Critical Success |
| 6  | Success  |
| 4-5  | Success with Consequences  |
| 1-3  | Failure with Consequences  |

Before rolling the dice, the Players have the option to change the size of the Dice Pool with certain [additional actions](action-roll-additions.md).

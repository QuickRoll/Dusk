# Actions

Actions are verbs that define a Characters preferred approach to certain situations. The verbs must be in [base form](https://www.grammar-monster.com/glossary/base_form.htm).

An Action has to be the following:

## Visual

An Action should inherently visually describe what is happening.

Example 1: Kill is not visual, use Actions such as Stab, Cut or Shoot instead.

Example 2: Heal should be replaced by Actions such as Bandage.

## Specific

Actions are not omnipotent and should not be universally applicable to everything.

Avoid Actions such as Do, Make or Take.

## Active

Actions should describe something a Character is doing outwardly.

Example: Know is not an outward Action, maybe use Study or Analyze.

## Current

Actions should not call back on things a Character might have done in the past.

Example: Remember or Recall both aren't very current.

## Not Basic

Characters are assumed to have basic competences. They will not require Actions such as Walk, Breathe, Read, Speak, Write or Hold.

# Inventory

Dusk utilizes a straightforward slot-based Inventory System where each item in the game requires a single Item Slot.

Although ammunition such as arrows, bullets, or similar items can be stacked, other items cannot. Game Masters may permit stacking for certain non-ammunition items.

The number of Item Slots available to a character is determined by the type of [armor](armor.md) they wear, with different armor types providing a varying number of slots.

Players have the option of adding backpacks to their armor, which can provide additional slots. The number of slots provided by a backpack is subject to the discretion of the Game Master.

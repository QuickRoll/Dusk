# The Dice Pool

Regardless of the type of roll you are making, the dice pool gets build in the same way.

The rating that a roll is based on determines the amount of six-sided dice that are rolled. From the roll you count the highest result with the exception of a roll based on a rating of 0. In which case you roll 2 dice and take the lowest result.

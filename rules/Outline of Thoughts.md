# Outline of Thoughts

- [ ] No Attributes only a list of Actions
- [ ] Action Roll and Reaction Roll
- [ ] stress = marking an action
- [ ] marked actions cannot be pushed or used for reaction
- [ ] harm = shocked (stacks) and bloodied / both need new names
- [ ] if character doesn't have appropriate action for the roll then 0d, using it to push or react marks another action of the players choosing
- [ ] if all actions marked then the character can't push, assist, react etc.
- [ ] no money, only trade

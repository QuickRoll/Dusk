A character can engage in activities that provide relief or pleasure, such as praying at a church, excessive drinking, or gambling, to reduce their Stress levels if approved by the Game Master.

To reduce Stress through activities, each player rolls a number of dice equal to their lowest Attribute Rating. The character's Stress level is then reduced by the highest value rolled. If a character has an Attribute Rating of 0, they instead roll two dice and use the lower value. However, if the value of the dice roll exceeds the character's Stress level, they will overindulge.

The Game Master will decide on the potential negative consequences of overindulging, which may include actions such as oversharing, revealing secrets, or starting a brawl.

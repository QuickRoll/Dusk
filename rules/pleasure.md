# Stress-reliefing Activities

A character can engage in activities that provide relief or pleasure, such as praying at a church, excessive drinking, or gambling, to reduce their Stress levels if approved by the Game Master.

To reduce Stress through activities, each player [rolls a number of dice](dice-pool.md) equal to their lowest Attribute Rating. The character's Stress level is then reduced by the result. If the value of the result exceeds the character's Stress level, they will overindulge.

The Game Master will decide on the potential negative consequences of overindulging, which may include actions such as oversharing, revealing secrets, or starting a brawl.

# Armor

Armor is a crucial aspect of a character's protection in Dusk, whether it be ornate robes or full-plate metal armor. When a character equips armor, several details should be recorded.

Firstly, note the name of the armor, with any additional equipment like backpacks added after the name.
Secondly, record the number of [item slots](inventory.md) that the armor provides.
Thirdly, record the maximum number of uses and the current number of uses left for the armor.
Finally, any additional effects that the armor may have should also be noted down, although this is optional and at the discretion of the Game Master.

The name and item slots are self-explanatory, but the uses refer to how many times the armor can be used before it needs to be repaired to restore it to its maximum uses. The armor effects, if any, are determined by the Game Master.

To use armor in Dusk, a character can simply utilize it whenever they suffer [Harm](harm.md) of any Level. The armor reduces the Level of Harm by one, even after a Resistance Roll. The uses of the armor can be stacked to reduce more than one Level of Harm.
